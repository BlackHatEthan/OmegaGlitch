# OmegaGlitch

OmegaGlitch is a highly destructive computer virus made in C++ that has the capacity to completely destroy your PC, I would advise if you are going to run this, that you have no personal info or important files on your computer. You shoudl run this on a VM!!!

This project contains a C++ program that simulates various glitch effects and visual disturbances for educational purposes. The code demonstrates how certain system resources and visual effects can be manipulated in a controlled environment. It is designed for learning purposes only and should never be run on real production systems. The program generates screen flickers, flashing lights, window spawning, and simulated system disturbances.

Important: This code is not intended to cause harm and should only be executed in safe, isolated environments such as virtual machines or sandboxes. Running this code on a production or critical system could result in undesired behavior and system instability.

Features

Visual Glitch Effects: Simulated screen distortion, pixel scrambling, and flashing windows.
Window Spawning: Spawns multiple windows continuously, creating chaos on the screen.
Simulated System Malfunctions: Mimics system crash effects, such as random errors and window popups.
Prerequisites

C++ Compiler (e.g., MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio, GCC, Clang).
Basic understanding of C++ and system programming (e.g., manipulating the system's resources and user interface).
Virtual Machine or Sandbox Environment (recommended for testing and running the code safely).
Setup

You can use MinGW to turn the .cpp file into a .exe file using the following command in the shell. 
```bash
g++ -o glitch_effect.exe main.cpp
```
If you do not have MinGW yuoi can simply just use VS code to compile it.
